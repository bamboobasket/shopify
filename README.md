# affiliatetheme.io

The affiliatetheme is a WordPress theme perfect for creating new affiliate websites, landing pages or satellite pages. It's an all-in-one solution that doesn't require any other affiliate plugins or any programming skills and helps to earn a income through affiliate marketing.

## Let's start...

### (required) Advanced Custom Fields Pro

The affiliatetheme (in any version) needs the premium plugin "ACF Pro" to work. When our theme was not yet public, the plugin was included with the purchase. However, this is no longer possible with the free / public version. The reason for this is simply the licensing terms of the plugin.

**UPDATE:** We spoke to Advanced Custom Fields and were able to negotiate a 30% coupon for you. Just enter `AFFILIATETHEME-G6LP23` at checkout or directly through the link below. Generally applies to the first year.

## More downloads...

### Child Theme

To make changes to your WordPress installation without overwriting everything during an update, a child theme is recommended. A tutorial on how to use our child theme can also be found on our YouTube.

### ATIO Plugins

To prevent the theme for being overloaded, we have outsourced various API interfaces in own plugins, which will also be partly paid later. The most important plugin is the Amazon API, which is completely free.
